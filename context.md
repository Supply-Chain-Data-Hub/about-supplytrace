 With increased interest in corporate ESG and responsible
                sourcing, coupled with pending supply chain, human rights due
                diligence and environmental legislation being enacted around the
                world, access to transparent, open data on forced labor and
                other abuses in global supply chains has never been more
                important - or sought after. A more thorough and complete
                understanding of supply chain conditions is increasingly likely
                to result in a significant shift in corporate purchasing
                practices and supply chain conditions.


                  Much of this data about supply chains exists in other places -
                but, more often than not, it is locked behind paywalls and
                grounded not in accountability, but in serving the interests of
                high paying customers. Opening up this type of data levels the
                playing field and provides equitable access to high quality
                information, to all.
