Launching to the public in Feb / March 2024, Phase 1 of the Data Hub will be centered on Xinjiang apparel data, to serve as proof of concept and pilot the platform. The Data Hub is being built for scale, with the ultimate intention to roll out the approach across other sectors, geographies, and categories of risk.

The tool combines expert desk-based risk investigations with machine learning/AI powered mapping of customs records and other supply chain relevant data. The result is an interactive dashboard that empowers all stakeholders to dive into supply chain transparency.
